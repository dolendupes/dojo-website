  <!-- Why We Exist -->

      <h2 class="font-inter font-bold text-4xl mb-8 text-dojo-red">Why We Exist</h2>
      
      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-dojo-gray leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Success in isolation is hollow. The modern professional landscape has created unprecedented opportunities for individual achievement, yet many high performers find themselves disconnected from meaningful community. Tampa's entrepreneurs, executives, and driven professionals need more than another gym membership or networking group – they need a place where excellence is expected, not exceptional.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          DOJO exists because we believe transformation happens at the intersection of physical challenge, mental discipline, and authentic connection. When exceptional individuals come together with shared purpose, the collective potential exceeds the sum of individual capabilities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We've watched too many talented people plateau, not from lack of ability, but from lack of challenge and accountability. DOJO changes that equation. Here, your success contributes to something greater than yourself, and the community's success elevates everyone within it.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-dojo-red pl-6 my-8 text-xl italic">
          "Iron sharpens iron. In the forge of shared struggle, we discover what we're truly capable of achieving."
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
          This isn't about creating another exclusive club. It's about curating a collective of individuals who understand that true strength – physical, mental, and professional – is built through deliberate practice and mutual support. DOJO exists to be the catalyst for transformation that ripples through every aspect of our members' lives.

            <p>
              DOJO isn't built for quick wins. We're creating something that will outlast us all – a legacy of excellence that becomes part of Tampa's fabric. Every decision considers not just immediate impact, but generational influence.
